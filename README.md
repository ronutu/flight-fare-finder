# Flight fare finder
This project was developed during my Robotic Process Automation (RPA) course, using UiPath Studio. It automates the process of extracting and comparing flight prices across multiple platforms. It begins by scanning Gmail for eSky promotional emails containing flight offers to various destinations. The bot extracts relevant information, such as destination, dates, and prices, and saves it to an Excel file. Next, it navigates to Google Flights and Skyscanner to search for the same flights on the specified dates and gathers the corresponding prices. Finally, it updates the Excel sheet to present a side-by-side comparison of eSky prices versus those from Google Flights and Skyscanner, providing a clear overview of the best available deals.
