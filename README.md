# rpa-flight-fare-finder
The aim of this project is to read marketing emails from eSky and find the cheapest flights. It will compare their offers to Google flights and Skyscanner. The output will be an .xlsx with all the locations, prices and dates.
The project uses RPA technology. It was done in UiPath Studio. It is also available on UiPath Orchestrator and it can be turned on from there.
